# What is Pandas?
# Pandas is a powerful and easy to use library primarily used for Data Analysis.
# Using Pandas You can do 
#   - Data Pre-Processing or Data Cleaning
#   - Data Manipulation
#   - Data Analysis (Primary)

# Pandas Provides its own Data Structures for storing and processing Data.
#   1. Series
#   2. DataFrame

# When to Use which one?

# Series
# Series is used to store and process 1D or Linear Data. eg like a list in Python.

# DataFrame
# DataFrame is used to store and process 2D or Tabular Data . eg like excel sheet

# Step 1 : import pandas
import pandas as pd

# sample data
prices = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

mySeries = pd.series(prices)

# what is mySeries?
type(mySeries)

# what does it contains?
print(mySeries)

# Quick Fact : Pandas Data Structures i.e Series/DataFrame uses ND Array
# Internally for Sorting and Processing Data.

# Confirmation
print(mySeries.values)

type(mySeries.values)

# pandas has access to nd array but not to numpy
# pandas internally uses nd array because it helps work fastly

# nd array provides only basic maths and array manipulations for pandas
# if we want complete mathematics we need to import numpy

print(mySeries.max())
print(mySeries.min())

# Creating DataFrame
nba = pd.read_csv('nba.csv')

# what is nba?
print(type(nba))

#what does it contains?
print(nba)

# nan represents missing values
# nan doesn't mean empty/blank

# Data Inspection

print(nba.shape)

# .column
print(nba.columns.tolist())

# .dataTypes
print(nba.dtypes)

# ** Note: Object Type Represents String Data in pandas **

# .describe() : returns statistical facts about all numerical columns.
print(nba.describe())

# .info()
print(nba.info())

# we can use this expression to exactly find the count of missing values
print(nba.isna().sum())

# .head()       -- returns first 5 rows of the data
print(nba.head())

# .tail()       -- returns last 5 rows of the data
print(nba.tail())

# to get the specified no.of rows
print(nba.head(3))

# Accessing a Single Column
# we can use two syntaxes
print(nba.Name.head(3))
print(nba['Name'].head(3))

# difference between above two is
# you cannot access columns having spaces in their title using (dot) expression.

# lets test it
# adding a new column
nba['my sport'] = 'basketball'

print(nba.head(3))

# deleting column
del nba['my sport']
print(nba.head(3))

# Accessing Multiple Columns
print(nba.head(3))

mycols = ['Name','College','Salary']
print(nba[mycols].head(3))

# Direct
print(nba[['Name','College','Salary']].head(3))

# Objective : You are asked to find players from a college named 'Texas'

# method 1
c1 = nba.College == 'Texas'
nba[c1]

# Direct Expression
nba[nba.College == 'Texas']

# Quick Activity:
# How many players are under the age of 25

under25 = nba[nba.Age < 25]
len(under25)

# Handling Multiple Conditions
# Objective: you are asked to find players from 'Texas' college palying for position 'PG'

c1 = nba.college == 'Texas'
c2 = nba.Position == 'PG'
nba[c1 & c2]    # here & is logical AND Operator

# Direct Expression
nba [ (nba.College == 'Texas') & (nba.Position == 'PG')]

# using OR
print(nba[(nba.Position == 'PF') | (nba.Position == 'C')])

# Finding all Players whose Salary is unavailable i.e NaN
print(nba[nba.Salary.isnull()])

# How would you find Players whose Salary is Available?
# opertors are applicable on values ex: !
# negation (~) is to apply on functions in place of not (!)
print(nba[~ nba.Salary.isnull()])

# Finding Players whose age is between 22 and 25
# Extracting Data in Range

print(nba[nba.Age.between(22,25)])

# Finding players whose age is not between 22 and 25
print(nba[~ nba.Age.between(22,25)])


# Sorting
# Descending
print(nba.sort_values(by = 'Age', ascending=False))

# Ascending
print(nba.sort_values(by = 'Age', ascending=True))

# You are asked to find the highest Paid Player playing from 'PG' Position and from TEam 'Memphis Grizzlies'
print(nba[(nba['Position'] == 'PG') & (nba['Team'] == 'Memphis Grizzlies')].sort_values(by='Salary', ascending=False).head(1))

# or
print(nba[(nba.Team == 'Memphis Grizzilies') & (nba.Position=='PG')].sort_values('Salary',ascending=False).head(1))

# SQL query for the same question
# select *
# from nba
# where team = 'Memphis Grizzlies' and position = 'PG'
# order by salary desc
# limit 1;

# Type Casting in Pandas

print(df[['Start Data','Last Login Time']].head())
print(df[['Start Date','Last Login Time']].dtypes)

# columns are values of given columns

# so to type cast the values of the respective columns i.e, from object to date and time

df['Start Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Date'])
print(df[['Start Date','Last Login Time']].dtypes)
# we can see the type of data for above one for start date will be datetime64[ns]

# Find the count of Team in Data?
