// therefore encapsulation helps control or restrict access
// to variable or functions using access specifiers

// when the variable is marked as private
// the variable is encapsulated in its own class.

// when the variable is marked as protected 
// the variable is encapsulated in its own class
// and in derived class

//when the variable is marked as default(no acceess modifier)
// then variable is encapsulated in all classes of same package in java

//when the variable is mareked as public is variable
// isn't encapsulated its visible/accessible to all

// we define boundaries using access modifiers
// and that boundary is called as encapsulation
