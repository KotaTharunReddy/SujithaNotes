# Data Types in Python
# String

# String represents text data, it can be a combination of characters, numbers and symbols
# eg.
# "python@123"
# note: any thing in quotation is string.

#Int
# Integer represents whole numbers,
# eg.
# 10, 2, 44

#Float
# Float represents Decimal Values.
# eg.
# 2.2, 0.0001

#Bool
# Bool represents Logical Values i.e True and False (observe Capital T and F)
