# Byte Code
# Byte codes are referred to as the portable codes or p-codes.

# When a python code is interpreted into the machine language
# then the python code gets converted into bytes.

# Bytecode is the low-level representation of the python code
# which is the platform-independent, but the code is not the
# binary code and so it cannot run directly on the targeted 
# machine.

# It is a set of instructions for the virtual machine which is 
# also called as the Python Virtual Machine[PVM].

# When the Python code is interpreted it is converted to the
# compiled bytecode file referred to as the PYC file.

# This pyc file contain compiled version of the source code
# which makes the code more efficient to run on the virtual
# machine

# Pyc files have the set of instructions to follow in sequence
# to generate the output.

# byte code file == pyc file (byte code file has .pyc extension)

# These pyc files are faster than the normal python code files

# python programming language is an interpreter language which
# converts the python code to the bytecode.

# These bytecodes are created by a compiler present inside
# the interpreter.

# interpreter first compiles the python code to the byte code
# which is also called as the intermediate code, then the code
# is used to run on the virtual machine.

# In the virtual machine, the library modules of the python get
# added and then the code is ready to run on a machine.
